title: A Garden of Words
excerpt: A collection of quotations!

Before I lose my roughed-up copy of _Swann's Way_ somewhere, I should probably do myself a favor and backup my favorite selections of those lovely words. I'll collect more here with time, but I'm hoping this'll remind me of my favorite bits and give me fun ideas--hopefully, recording similes and turns of phrase from people much better at writing than I am can put me on the right track.

I think Proust himself puts this best:
> What does it matter thenceforth if the actions, and the emotions, of this new order of creatures seem to us true, since we have made them ours, since it is within us that they occur, that they hold within their control, as we feverishly turn the pages of the book, the rapidity of our breathing and the intensity of our gaze. And once the novelist has put us in that state, in which, as in all purely internal states, every emotion is multiplied tenfold, in which his book will disturb us as might a dream but a dream more lucid than those we have while sleeping and whose memory will last longer, then see how he provokes in us within one hour all possible happiness and all possible unhappiness just a few of which we would spend years of our lives coming to know and the most intense of which woudl never be revealed to us because the slowness with which they occur prevents us from perceiving them (thus our heart changes, in life, and it is the worst pain; but we do know it is only through reading, through our imagination: in reality it changes, as certain natural phenomena occur, slowly enough so that, if we are able to observe successively each of its different states, in return we are spared the actual sensation of change) (_Swann's Way_, 87).

From _Swann's Way_, by Marcel Proust:

Proust can be a bit of a drag, but such a savory one. Descriptions can become extremely long-winded and you'll find that you've spent 20 pages reading about something that happened as someone was lifting a teacup. But his volumes are really touching--they get to you in a really personal way. Each of them is a story riddled with magnificiently-put observations that don't feel philosophical but do display what a keen observer Proust is of the human condition.

> A thousand small useless details--the charming prodigality of the pharmacist--that would have been eliminated in an artificial preparation gave me, like a book in which one is amazed to encounter the name of a person one knows, the pleasure of realizing that these were actually stems of real lime blossoms, like those I saw in the avenue de la Gare, altered precisely because they were not duplicates but themselves, and becaues they had aged (52).

> These were the events taking place in the book I was reading; it is true that the people affected by them were not "real"... But all the feelings we are made to experience by the joy or misfortune of a real person are produced in us only through the intermediary of an image of that joy or that misfortune; the ingeniousness of the first novelist consisted in understanding that in the apparatus of our emotions, the image being the only essential element, the simplification that would consist in purely and simply abolishing real people would be a decisive improvement. A real human being, however profoundly we sympathize with him, is in large part perceived by our senses, that is to say, remains opaque to us, presents a dead weight whcih our sensibility cannot lift. If a calamity should strike him, it is only in a small part of the total notion we have of him that we will be able to be moved by this; even more, it is only in a part of the total notion he has of himself that he will be able to be moved himself. The novelist's happy discovery was to have the idea of replacing these parts, inseparable to the soul, by an equal quantity of immaterial parts, that is to say, parts which  our soul can assimilate (86-87).

> "Monsieur, I absolutely cannot tell you if it has been raining. I live so resolutely beyond physical contingencies that my senses do not bother to notify me of them." (94)

I don't think there's anything "deep" or particularly insightful about this one, but this bit from a conversation between the narrator's father and friend Bloch is probably one of the funniest lines I've ever read in a book. You can almost imagine Bloch's deadpan face as he's saying this. There's a wonderful juxtaposition between the utter stupidity of what he's saying and the somehow marvelously crafted words he's using to clothe the thought.

> but what delighted me were the asparagus, steeped in ultramarine and pink, whose tips, delicately painted with little strokes of mauve and azure, shade off imperceptibly down to their feet--still soiled though they are from the dirt of their garden bed--with an iridescence that is not of these earth. It seemed to me that these celestial hues revealed the delicious creatures who had merrily metamorphosed themselves into vegetables and who, through the disguise of their firm, edible flesh, disclosed in these early tints of dawn, in these beginnings of rainbows, in this extinction of blue evenings, the precious essence that I recognized again when, all night long following dinner at which I had eaten them, they played, in farces as crude and poetic as a fairy play by Shakespeare, at changing my chamber pot into a jar of perfume (123-124).

Proust somehow manages to make asparagus sound more tasty and beautiful and appealing than anything I could ever hope to cook. I really love how he transitions into personifying the aspargus--they're at once beautiful, celestial beings and merry, mischevious creatures. I wonder if the jar of perfume is the gas that asparagus tends to give you :)

> But at the name of Guermantes, I saw a little brown notch appear in the center of each of our friend's blue eyes as if they had been stabbed by invisible pinpoints, while the rest of the pupil reacted by secreting floods of azure. The arc of his eyelids darkened and drooped. And his mouth, marked by a bitter fold, but recovering more quickly, smiled while his eyes remained sorrowful, like the eyes of a handsome martyr whose body bristles with arrows (130)

What I loved about this bit was the way it feels as if Legrandin's eyes are something as monumental, as large, as impactful as an ocean. There are certainly writers who manage to deploy simile (Homer) and plain old description to great effect, but there's almost a larger-than-life feel to what's going on in Legrandin's face here. Also a fan of how the narrator, by mentioning the name Guermantes to Legrandin, "was assuming a sort of power over [the name], by the mere fact of bringing it out of [his] daydreams and giving it an objective existence in the world of sound" (130).

> but even in his most artificial creations, man is still working upon nature; certain places will always impose their own particular empire on their surroundings, hoist their immemorial insignia in the middle of a park just as they would have done far from any human intervention, in a solitude which returns to surround them wherever they are, arising from the exigencies of the position they occupy and superimposed on the work of human hands (139).

Nature is a boss. There's simultaneously something soothing and trivializing about this observation: that certain places have such a strong imprint that they will assert themselves without our help. Whether that be building a monument or house or making it look "prettier" in some other fashion, it's really the personality of that part of nature that shines, with or without our help. But it also seems a little arrogant to think otherwise.

> But at the age, already a little disillusioned, which Swann was approaching, at which one knows how to content oneself with being in love for the pleasure of it without requiring too much reciprocity, this closeness of two hearts, if it is no longer, as it was in one's earliest youth, the goal toward which love necessarily tends, still remains linked to it by an association of ideas so strong that it may become the cause of love, if it occurs first. At an earlier time one dreamed of possessing the heart of the woman with whom one was in love; later, to feel that one possesses a woman's heart may be enough to make one fall in love with her (204).

This sounds like something I'd really only fully understand if I were getting to the Swann's age. Maybe for another decade!
