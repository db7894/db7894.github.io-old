company_description:
- The Music Information Retrieval Lab is an Engineering lab at Harvey Mudd College that conducts research at the intersection of Machine Learning, Signal Processing, and Music.
team:
- Daniel Bashir, Mek Jenrungrot, Carrie (Xinyu) Yang (worked in separate teams of two with each)
stack: Python, NLTK, Pandas, Scipy, Numpy, Matplotlib, Keras
contribution:
- Wrote a script to scrape 400K pdf files from the online IMSLP music database
- Implemented a sheet music comparison system based on Deep Matching (a paper) that achieved >.94 MRR.
- Developed object detection systems to identify numerous small objects in a high-quality image (notes in music).
- Devised algorithms for comparing two pages of sheet music and hashing for a database of >4M pages of music.
- (on my own) Implemented an algorithm to represent lines of sheet music by binary vectors for comparison and performed statistical analyses using this data
- Created data from the MSMD dataset and trained an RNN architecture to recognize noteheads in sheet music
