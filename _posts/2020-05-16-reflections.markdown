title: Graduating into a Pandemic

We made it! Sort of.

Like many other students my age, I'm sitting in my bedroom, typing at a laptop during the Class of 2020's graduation weekend.
Ordinarily, this would (probably) be a weekend of revelry, culminating in on a fateful Sunday when we don ceremonial caps and gowns, sit under a tent and listen to speeches, collect diplomas, take pictures... you get the point.

Instead, we're sitting in various spots across the country, reflecting on four important years of our lives and looking at the uncertain world ahead. We're about to jump off a diving board into murky waters, but I think now's a good time to reflect on what just passed us by.

One of the key factors for my college decision was a conversation I had with Patrick McHonett, a Claremont McKenna graduate, in my high school's admissions office. The way he encouraged me to consider the situation was something like this: in four years, you are going to be a very different person. In many ways, that person will be shaped by the college that you went to. He didn't mean this in an "I-went-to-elite-school-X-look-at-all-this-prestige" sort of way. Rather, each school has a student body and wealth of experiences to offer that are, by definition, unique to that school. My experience at Harvey Mudd would send me into the world as a different person from the person I'd be had I gone to some school on the East Coast, and vice versa.

Looking ahead to leaving sunny Claremont behind (notwithstanding the technicality that I've already left sunny Claremont for sunny Scottsdale), now's as good a time as any to think about those words. Who am I today? In what ways did my experience at Harvey Mudd affect me as a person?

I'll dispense with the facts first. I am about to graduate with a BS in Computer Science and Mathematics. I got through my classes without too much drama and maintained a decent GPA. Not an amazing GPA, but one I'm okay with. I did some research and an engineering internship. I participated in student government, didn't drink or party much, and increasingly kept to myself over my four years. All in all, nothing overly atypical.

But there's a lot more to a college experience beyond cold facts. If there's one succint way I could describe my experience at Harvey Mudd, it would be an extended exercise in being okay with myself.

I entered college _very_ ready for a completely fresh start. As a former kid-with-anger-issues, socially inept pre-teen, then somewhat less socially inept teen, I managed to make something of a mockery of myself throughout my grade school years. Determined to make up for the years I was barred from student government and normal social interaction, I drew on every ounce of my ability to act like a human shitpost and somehow wormed by way into becoming class co-president.

It was that endeavor that helped me realize a number of things about my own character. My freshman co-president and I managed to do what I think was a pretty good job in our roles, planning events and engaging with our class. But I withdrew from her, and by the time sophomore year rolled around, my new co-president and I weren't doing a whole lot. I'm not a natural extrovert, and the role of class president demands a lot of energy from its bearer, particularly social energy.

I'd managed to muster enough of that social energy to land myself the role as a freshman, but if there's one thing characteristic of the introvert experience, it's that keeping up high levels of social activity is difficult to sustain. I think my friend aptly described how that looked when he told me: "Dude, I remember how you started college at 100 and now you're pretty much at 50."

I am pretty much at 50. At some point, I definitely became more work-focused. Or, to be more accurate, I returned to being more work-focused. I all but discontinued late-night outings and events, didn't drink or go to parties, and became less spontaneous.
