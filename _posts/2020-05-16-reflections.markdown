title: Graduating into a Pandemic
excerpt: Time for reflection!
---

We made it! Sort of.

Like many other students my age, I'm sitting in my bedroom, typing at a laptop during the Class of 2020's graduation weekend.
Ordinarily, this would (probably) be a weekend of revelry, culminating in on a fateful Sunday when we don ceremonial caps and gowns, sit under a tent and listen to speeches, collect diplomas, take pictures... you get the point.

Instead, we're sitting in various spots across the country, reflecting on four important years of our lives and looking at the uncertain world ahead. We're about to jump off a diving board into murky waters, but I think now's a good time to reflect on what just passed us by.

One of the key factors for my college decision was a conversation I had with Patrick McHonett, a Claremont McKenna graduate, in my high school's admissions office. The way he encouraged me to consider the situation was something like this: in four years, you are going to be a very different person. In many ways, that person will be shaped by the college that you went to. He didn't mean this in an "I-went-to-elite-school-X-look-at-all-this-prestige" sort of way. Rather, each school has a student body and wealth of experiences to offer that are, by definition, unique to that school. My experience at Harvey Mudd would send me into the world as a different person from the person I'd be had I gone to some school on the East Coast, and vice versa.

Looking ahead to leaving sunny Claremont behind (notwithstanding the technicality that I've already left sunny Claremont for sunny Scottsdale), now's as good a time as any to think about those words. Who am I today? In what ways did my experience at Harvey Mudd affect me as a person?

I'll dispense with the facts first. I am about to graduate with a BS in Computer Science and Mathematics. I got through my classes without too much drama and maintained a decent GPA. Not an amazing GPA, but one I'm okay with. I did some research and an engineering internship. I participated in student government, didn't drink or party much, and increasingly kept to myself over my four years. All in all, nothing overly atypical.

But there's a lot more to a college experience beyond cold facts. If there's one succint way I could describe my experience at Harvey Mudd, it would be an extended exercise in being okay with myself.

I entered college _very_ ready for a completely fresh start. As a former kid-with-anger-issues, socially inept pre-teen, then somewhat less socially inept teen, I managed to make something of a mockery of myself throughout my grade school years. Determined to make up for the years I was barred from student government and normal social interaction, I drew on every ounce of my ability to act like a human shitpost and somehow wormed by way into becoming class co-president.

It was that endeavor that helped me realize a number of things about my own character. My freshman co-president and I managed to do what I think was a pretty good job in our roles, planning events and engaging with our class. But I withdrew from her, and by the time sophomore year rolled around, my new co-president and I weren't doing a whole lot. I'm not a natural extrovert, and the role of class president demands a lot of energy from its bearer, particularly social energy.

I'd managed to muster enough of that social energy to land myself the role as a freshman, but if there's one thing characteristic of the introvert experience, it's that keeping up high levels of social activity is difficult to sustain. I think my friend aptly described how that looked when he told me: "Dude, I remember how you started college at 100 and now you're pretty much at 50."

In thinking about how I got to that 50, the fact that I decided to attend a highly technical college speaks to me most as the reason. I entered college as a speech and debate kid, mediocre violinst / tennis player, etc. If there's one thing a place like Mudd forces on you, it's a disturbingly singular focus on your career that lasts the entire time you're there. Any free time you have, if you have it, should be spent building a side project or practicing for interviews. It's the only way to get somewhere, it often feels.

I could never quite play the game that way. I did a lot of the things other people did: research, a software engineering internship, a side project or two so I could say I'd done _something_ (although I was actually very interested in at least two of those projects--neither was particularly impressive). But I tried to preserve things like sleep, reading, and exercise.

At the end of the day, I always wonder if I actually got the "full value" from my education, or if I should have spent more hours writing code and preparing for interviews. I could certainly be in a different place right now. But one thing I've learned to accept is that while your career feels all-consuming, there's so much more to leading a fulfilling life than being able to invert a binary search tree or develop your own library.

I'm pretty sure there are a lot of people with Mudd at good intentions who understand this really well. It's why we have a Humanities requirement, why I see HEATLab sharing articles suggesting that you take another humanities class rather than a tech class on its Facebook page. But I'm not sure how well the message gets across: in many of my classes, I've heard other students looking for the easiest "hums" (Mudd slang for anything that doesn't fall under the STEM umbrella, although I'll note one excecption: "It's a super hum!" - Conner DiPaolo, speaking about an Advanced Linear Algebra class I sat in on for a few lectures), complaining about the number we were required to take, etc.

But I think you lose a lot when your approach to something like choosing your humanities classes is: "Which humanities minor will be the best for my career (economics, probably) and how can I take the path of least resistance through all those other hums I have to take so I can focus on my technical classes?"

Harvey Mudd prides itself on delivering to the rest of the world engineers, scientists, etc. who have a "clear understanding of the impact of their work on society." We do this a bit, but I don't know that everyone gets the message that focusing solely on your tech classes and thinking of the humanities as a "break" from all the hard work you're doing is a good way to become an effective and conscious human being.

As physicists, chemists, software engineers, scientists, chemical engineers, etc. we don't live in a vacuum. We live in a world where our work will impact people in a whole lot of different ways, but to understand many of those things you're also going to have to understand how people and societies and lots of other things function. If you go to work for Facebook, a feature you build or manage could have a massive impact on thousands of people's mental health. Or, like five people's. But you need to understand and consider that, and without having made an effort to gather insights into the way people think and respond to things, you may not be equipped with the tools necessary to describe and understand the effects you're having.

At least, these are the things I say to convince myself that the hours I spent reading Dostoevsky and Proust and even Tolkien I guess weren't a total waste. We exist and build our lives on the shoulders of a whole lot of people who came before us. I (and the rest of us) are fortunate to be heirs to an intellectual tradition that has scoured the depths of the human mind to consider and understand a lot of very meaningful things.

I think we have a responsibility (at least, those of us who are lucky enough to have the time--but if you went to a place like Mudd, I think you're probably well-positioned to have that time at some point, if not now) to draw on the knowledge and ideas and insights of the people who've spent so much time attempting to understand the human condition, to explain and argue for democracy, to contend with the intricacies and difficulties of religious belief.

And drawing on the collective wisdom and genius of your human ancestry does a whole lot more than make your life easier. If you let it, it'll help you be more thoughtful and considerate in your daily interactions with other people, your career decisions, and in how you treat yourself, among other things. But just like anything else worth doing, it takes concerted effort.

As I'm looking back on my years in college and ahead to whatever comes next, I'm glad that I tried to hold onto the more humanistic things I've been fortunate enough to spend time with.
