title: Graduation! And Covid.

We made it! Sort of.

I'm sitting in my bedroom, typing at a laptop on the Harvey Mudd College Class of 2020's graduation weekend.
Ordinarily, this would (probably) be a weekend of revelry, culminating in on a fateful Sunday when we don ceremonial caps and gowns, sit under a tent and listen to some speeches, collect our diplomas, take pictures... you get the point.

Instead, we're sitting in various spots across the country, reflecting on four important years of our lives and looking at the uncertain world ahead. We're about to jump off a diving board into murky waters, but I think now's a good time to reflect on what just passed us by.

One of the key factors for my college decision was a conversation I had with Patrick McHonett, a Claremont McKenna graduate, in my high school's admissions office. The way he encouraged me to consider the situation was something like this: in four years, you are going to be a very different person. In many ways, that person will be shaped by the college that you went to. He didn't mean this in an "I-went-to-elite-school-X-look-at-all-this-prestige" sort of way. Rather, each school has a student body and wealth of experiences to offer that are, by definition, unique to that school. My experience at Harvey Mudd would send me into the world as a different person from the person I'd be had I gone to some school on the East Coast, and vice versa.

Looking ahead to leaving sunny Claremont behind (notwithstanding the technicality that I've already left sunny Claremont for sunny Scottsdale), now's as good a time as any to think about those words. Who am I today? In what ways did my experience at Harvey Mudd affect me as a person?

I'll dispense with the facts first. I am about to graduate with a BS in Computer Science and Mathematics. I got through my classes without too much drama and maintained a decent GPA. Not an amazing GPA, but one I'm okay with. I did some research and an engineering internship. I participated in student government, didn't drink or party much, and increasingly kept to myself over my four years. All in all, nothing overly atypical.

But there's a lot more to a college experience beyond cold facts. If there's one succint way I could describe my experience at Harvey Mudd, it would be an extended exercise in being okay with myself.
