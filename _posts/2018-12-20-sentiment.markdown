contribution:
- I manipulated data of the presidential state of the union addresses using Pandas, Scipy and Numpy libraries
- Using NLTK, I extracted data from the addresses using Topic Modeling, Sentiment Analysis, T-SNE, and informational entropy.
- I used the matplotlib library to generate graphs and perform data analysis and created WordClouds to analyze text.
- I wrote a <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/sentiment-of-the-union-analyzing-presidential-state-of-the-union-addresses-with-python-2a8667a578b9">Medium article</a> where I compared my insights from the data with historical observations to assess the accuracy.
