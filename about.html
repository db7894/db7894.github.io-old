<p align="left" style="padding: 0px 30px 0px 30px">I'm a senior Joint Major in Computer Science and Mathematics at Harvey Mudd College. My coursework at Harvey Mudd has included a wide survey of STEM subjects including Chemistry, Physics, Engineering, and so on from Harvey Mudd's Core. Recent courses I've taken have focused on topics and areas such as machine learning, statistics, and algorithms. In addition, my passion for other areas has led me to take courses in Economics, Political Science, and Philosophy.</p>

<p align="left" style="padding: 0px 30px 0px 30px">I'm Pakistani-American (US-born)--fun fact: I've probably spent as many New Year's in Lahore as in the States (this might become less true in the next few years).

Besides my interest in machine learning, I care a lot about considering the effect of the systems and tools I build on the real world and finding ways to minimize cognitive bias in decision-making processes. I enjoy writing from time to time on topics such as South Asian American identity.

In my free time, I love reading fiction, biographies, philosophy, journalism, poetry, you name it. I enjoy playing the violin and staying active, and I'm a Bollywood addict.
