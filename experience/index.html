  <h2 style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 10px;">Experience</h2><br>
  <!-- <p style="padding: 0px 20px 0px 20px;">While you'll see that most of my experience is in research, I really care about making a concrete impact on the world around me and helping people live better lives. To that end, it's my goal to work in industry where I can do work that both speaks to me (on the level of my love for math, algorithms, and so on), but also has real-world uses and benefits for other people.</p> -->
  <p style="padding: 0px 30px 0px 10px;">In August 2020, I'll be joining <b>Amazon</b> as an <b>Applied Scientist Intern</b> on the Personalization team.</p>
  <p style="padding: 0px 30px 0px 10px;">From May to August 2019, I worked at <b>Amazon Web Services</b> as a <b>Software Development Engineer Intern</b> on the AutoML Team. I developed a benchmarking library in Python for different AutoML systems that automated the process of processing datasets on S3, running training jobs on SageMaker, and collecting results using Cloudwatch.</p>
  <p style="padding: 0px 30px 0px 10px;">Since January 2019, I have been involved in the <b>AMISTAD Lab</b> with professor <a href='http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~gmontane/'>George Monta√±ez</a>, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Harvey Mudd College. My research focuses on developing a theoretical framework for overfitting and underfitting.</p>

  <p style="padding: 0px 30px 0px 10px;">From January to December 2018 I was involved in the <b>Music Information Retrieval Lab</b> at Harvey Mudd College. As a member of this lab, I primarily worked on a project involving utilizing computer vision and object detection techniques to develop a system that could take an image of a page of sheet music and identify the name of the piece by searching for it in a massive database.</p>

  <p style="padding: 0px 30px 0px 10px;">During this project, I learned a great deal about deep learning through completing fast.ai where I learned about the Keras, Theano and Tensorflow libraries as well as the mathematics behind deep learning involving Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks. I learned how to use Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup to implement a web scraper to download more than 400,000 PDFs from a website, implemented and iterated a number of machine learning architectures to solve various problems in Python, and performed a great deal of data manipulation and visualization using libraries such as Pandas in order to better understand our problem.</p>

<h2 style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">Coursework</h2>
<p style="padding: 0px 30px 0px 30px;">Because of Harvey Mudd's Core requirements, I spent my first three semesters straddled between all disciplines that Harvey Mudd offers. Mudd requires all students to take a set list of courses from Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, and Critical Inquiry / Writing during the first three semesters. While I found that this leaves time for major-specific courses and work pretty limited until the end of sophomore year, I think it provided the benefit that I had exposure to a great deal of areas in STEM and really have a passion for what I want to focus on.</p>

  <h2 style="padding: 0px 30px 0px 20px;">Teaching and Leadership</h2>
  <p style="padding: 0px 30px 0px 20px;">I'm passionate about leadership and trying to make an impact on my campus and the people around me. To that end, I served as Diversity Director on the Executive Board of the Associated Students of Harvey Mudd College (ASHMC), HMC's student government. I oversaw and helped diversity-related groups and organizations in their efforts to create a more inclusive atmosphere on campus, and helped support on-campus activities and services designed to promote diversity. Two examples of projects I've helped work on include the Riggs Room, a space for diversity groups on Harvey Mudd's campus, and the ASHMC Textbook Library, a service for students to freely borrow and use textbooks for their core and major classes without having to deal with the financial burden of purchasing them.</p>

  <p style="padding: 0px 30px 0px 20px;">In Fall 2018, I served on a Hiring Comimttee to interview and select candidates for Harvey Mudd's Associate Dean of Institutional Diversity. In Fall 2019, I served on a Student Hiring Committee to aid in the selection process for new Computer Science Professors.</p>

  <p style="padding: 0px 30px 0px 20px;">During my freshman and sophomore year, I served as Co-President of the Class of 2020, where I put on events to promote interaction and bonding both among students and between students and professors and served as a liaison between students and ASHMC. As a member of Senate, I helped craft policy and voted on various proposals from funding/budgeting requests to changes in ASHMC's constituation.</p>

  <p style="padding: 0px 30px 0px 20px;">My sophomore year, I was a Mentor for APISPAM, Harvey Mudd's Asian / Pacific Islander affinity group. I helped mentor API-identifying freshmen and put on events related to issues faced by the API community.</p>

  <p style="padding: 0px 30px 0px 20px;">In Fall 2020, I TAed for CS181P (Machine Learning, Info, and Search). In Spring 2019, I TAed for CS 158 (Machine Learning) and CS 140 (Algorithms) at Harvey Mudd College. For these classes, I held office hours, graded assignments, held exam review sessions, and wrote problems. In Fall 2017, I TAed for the advanced section of CS5 (Introduction to Computer Science) at Harvey Mudd College, and for CS35 (Data Science) in Spring of 2018.</p>
